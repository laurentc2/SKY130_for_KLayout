Within KLayout, create the technolgy SKY130 by the menu : **[Tools]-[Manage Technologies]**  
Then press + at the bottom left, you will add a new technology that you can call : _SKY130_

Then, you can copy the file **SKY130.lyp**, **SKY130.lyt** and the 2 directories **drc** and **lvs** of that repository in your directory :  
`$HOME/.klayout/tech/SKY130  (under Linux)`  
`#HOMEDATA#/klayout/tech/SKY130  (under Windows)`

Due to few **SKY130 GDS** cases found and tested, the DRC/LVS files have not been extensively tested and still probably have bugs for some cases.
It was tested on the GDS and spice netlists of the LIB_CASES directory.
The more we can publish **SKY130 GDS** files, the better those DRC/LVS files.
At that stage, the GDS needs another checks before tape-out.
